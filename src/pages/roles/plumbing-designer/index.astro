	{
		question: 'What does a Plumbing Designer produce on a MEP project?',
		answer:
			'A Plumbing Designer produces domestic water distribution layouts (hot, cold, recirculation), sanitary and storm drainage plans, pipe sizing calculations, fixture unit schedules, plumbing fixture plans, riser diagrams, and equipment connection details. They work in coordination with mechanical and electrical disciplines under your licensed plumbing engineer or EOR.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Who is responsible for code compliance and stamping?',
		answer:
			'Your licensed Engineer of Record retains full design authority and stamp responsibility. Our Plumbing Designers produce drawings and sizing documentation under your direction, requiring your PE/EOR review and sign-off before any permit submission.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What software do your Plumbing Designers work in?',
		answer:
			'Our specialists work in Revit MEP for coordinated 3D plumbing models, AutoCAD for 2D production drafting, and BIM 360 / Autodesk Construction Cloud for cloud-based project coordination. We align with your preferred platform and match your firm\'s layer standards and sheet templates.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do Plumbing Designers coordinate with HVAC and electrical teams?',
		answer:
			'Plumbing Designers coordinate with other MEP disciplines through federated Revit models or linked AutoCAD files, participating in clash detection reviews via Navisworks or ACC. They flag conflicts proactively and update drawings to reflect coordination resolutions from your team\'s review process.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the typical cost savings vs. a US-based Plumbing Designer?',
		answer:
			'US-based Plumbing Designers typically cost $65,000–$95,000/year fully loaded. LATAM-based equivalents through LatAm Scalers start at approximately $3,500/month — a savings of 50–65% with no compromise on technical output quality.',
