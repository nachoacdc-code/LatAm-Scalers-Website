		question: 'What does a dedicated Revit Drafter handle?',
		answer:
			'Our Revit Drafters handle production workflows: construction document sets, plan/section/elevation development, details, schedules, redline revisions, and BIM model updates in Revit. They work in AutoCAD and Bluebeam as well, depending on your deliverable format.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they align to our firm standards?',
		answer:
			'During onboarding we share your Revit templates, title blocks, layer standards, annotation styles, and BEP. Drafters work inside your standards from day one and QA deliverables against your checklist before submitting.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they handle redlines and iterative revisions?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Redline response and iterative revision cycles are core to what our drafters do. You mark up in Bluebeam or PDF, we update in Revit, and return revised drawings — typically same day or next morning for your review.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What formats and deliverables do they produce?',
		answer:
			'Drafters deliver in your preferred format: Revit (RVT), AutoCAD (DWG), or PDF. Typical outputs include CD plan sets, detail sheets, schedules, coordination drawings, and export-ready packages aligned to your plotsheet standards.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does pricing look like?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Revit Drafters start at approximately $3,500/month for full-time (40h/week). Part-time (20h/week) options and multi-drafter configurations are available. Custom quotes provided based on scope and volume.',
