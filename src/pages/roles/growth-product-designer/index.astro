		question: 'What is a Growth Product Designer?',
		answer:
			'A Growth Product Designer owns the intersection of product design and conversion metrics — focusing on activation, onboarding, feature adoption, and revenue-driving flows. They work from user research and analytics, designing and iterating on experiences that move users from signup → onboarding → aha moment → retention. Unlike feature designers, growth designers are metrics-obsessed and ship fast.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they work with product managers and data analysts?',
		answer:
			'Growth Product Designers collaborate with product teams to identify high-impact conversion bottlenecks, design solutions, run A/B tests, and measure impact. They receive business metrics and user insights, then prototype and iterate rapidly. Most work in 1–2 week sprints with weekly stakeholder sync-ups.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What metrics do they focus on?',
		answer:
			'Growth designers typically own metrics like signup-to-aha time, feature adoption rates, user retention, churn reduction, and revenue-per-user flows. They work backward from business goals (lower churn, higher activation) and design the user experience to unlock those metrics.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they run A/B tests and analyze results?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Growth Product Designers work in collaboration with analytics teams to set up experiments, but they specialize in the design and iteration side. They partner with data teams to measure impact and learn from user behavior data.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does a Growth Product Designer cost?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Growth Product Designers start at approximately $3,000–$3,500/month for full-time engagement (40h/week). US-based equivalents typically cost $80,000–$130,000/year fully loaded — LATAM-based specialists save 55–70% with comparable design velocity and metrics focus.',
