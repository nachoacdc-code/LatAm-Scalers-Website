		question: 'What does a Visualization Specialist produce?',
		answer:
			'A Visualization Specialist creates photorealistic 3D renderings, animations, and presentation materials from architectural and design models. They work in tools like Enscape, Lumion, V-Ray, and 3ds Max to produce client presentations, design marketing materials, design communication visuals, and stakeholder presentations — transforming CAD/BIM models into compelling visual media.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they work from our Revit models?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Your Visualization Specialist works directly from Revit, SketchUp, and other BIM formats. They import your models, add materials, lighting, entourage, and render photorealistic images and animations. They can work in your Revit models or receive exports — workflow is discussed during the scoping call.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What software proficiencies do you match for?',
		answer:
			'We match specialists proficient in Enscape (real-time rendering from Revit), Lumion (high-speed, cinematic rendering), V-Ray (premium photorealism for Revit and 3ds Max), and SketchUp visualization — based on your preferred tool and project aesthetic requirements.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they handle design iterations and revisions quickly?',
		answer:
			'Yes. One of the key benefits of remote visualization is speed — your Visualization Specialist can produce quick iteration cycles and design option renderings. Revisions are typically turnaround in 24–48 hours depending on scope.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does a Visualization Specialist cost?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Visualization Specialists start at approximately $3,500/month for full-time engagement (40h/week). US-based equivalents typically cost $65,000–$95,000/year fully loaded — LATAM-based specialists save 50–65% with no compromise on rendering quality or speed.',
