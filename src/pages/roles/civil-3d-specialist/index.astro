	{
		question: 'What does a Civil 3D Specialist do?',
		answer:
			'A Civil 3D Specialist produces infrastructure design deliverables using Autodesk Civil 3D: roadway alignments and profiles, grading and drainage layouts, corridor models, utility design, and construction sheets. They work in full 3D environments and produce TIN models, surface analysis, and cross-sections aligned to your project standards and local design codes.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they handle multiple project types (roads, sites, drainage)?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Civil 3D Specialists we match you with typically have breadth across site development, roadway design, and grading/drainage work. Depth in specific project types (highway design, water/wastewater, rail) is confirmed during the scoping call so we match the right specialist to your project scope.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they coordinate with structural and architectural disciplines?',
		answer:
			'Civil 3D Specialists export design data (grading plans, site layouts, utility coordination) to formats compatible with Revit and AutoCAD architectural/structural workflows. They participate in coordination meetings and adjust designs based on feedback from other disciplines.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the cost difference vs. a US-based Civil 3D Specialist?',
		answer:
			'US-based Civil 3D Specialists typically cost $70,000–$110,000/year fully loaded. LATAM-based equivalents through LatAm Scalers start at approximately $3,500/month ($42,000/year) — a savings of 50–70% with no reduction in technical quality.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How quickly can we onboard a Civil 3D Specialist?',
		answer:
			'We typically present vetted candidates within 48 hours of a scoping call. Once project standards, drawing templates, and tool access are confirmed, most specialists ramp up within one week.',
	},
