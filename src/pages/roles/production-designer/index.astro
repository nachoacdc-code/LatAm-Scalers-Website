		question: 'What is a Production Designer?',
		answer:
			'A Production Designer is a design executor — they take strategic direction and creative briefs from senior designers/art directors and translate them into production-ready assets. They handle design implementation, asset production, file management, and quality control. While strategists create concepts, production designers scale and execute at high volume.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What types of assets do they produce?',
		answer:
			'Production Designers create social media graphics, email templates, web assets, banner ads, marketing collateral, print files, and brand-compliant design deliverables. They work from templates, design systems, and direction from senior creatives.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they differ from a Brand Designer?',
		answer:
			'Brand Designers are generalists creating brand systems and comprehensive design work. Production Designers are specialists in high-volume asset execution and consistency enforcement. For agencies, having dedicated production designers frees senior designers for strategy and creative innovation.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they work with multiple clients/projects?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Production Designers often juggle multiple client projects, working from shared design systems and templates. Agency workflow typically involves weekly/bi-weekly campaign cycles with production designers handling asset creation and QA.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does a Production Designer cost?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Production Designers start at approximately $2,800–$3,200/month for full-time engagement (40h/week). US-based equivalents typically cost $55,000–$80,000/year fully loaded — LATAM-based specialists save 50–60% with comparable production quality and efficiency.',
