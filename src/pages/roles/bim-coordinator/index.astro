	{
		question: 'Do your BIM Coordinators work in Navisworks, ACC, and BIM 360?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Our specialists are proficient in Navisworks Manage for clash detection and 4D scheduling, Autodesk Construction Cloud for document and model coordination, and BIM 360 for cloud-based collaboration. We align with your preferred platform.',
