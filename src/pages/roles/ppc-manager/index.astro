		question: 'What platforms does a dedicated PPC Manager manage?',
		answer:
			'Our PPC Managers manage paid search campaigns on Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising, and paid social campaigns on Meta Ads (Facebook and Instagram). Many also manage LinkedIn Ads, Pinterest Ads, or TikTok Ads depending on your channel mix. We match based on your specific platform requirements.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Do they handle ad creative or just campaign management?',
		answer:
			'PPC Managers handle campaign strategy, audience targeting, bidding, budget pacing, A/B testing, and performance optimization — not ad creative production. For creative assets (images, video, copy), you\'ll want a dedicated designer or content marketer. PPC Managers write ad copy variations as part of testing.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they report on campaign performance?',
		answer:
			'Your PPC Manager delivers weekly performance summaries and monthly in-depth reports covering spend, impressions, CTR, CPC, conversions, ROAS, and CPA. They build dashboards in Looker Studio (formerly Google Data Studio) connected to your ad accounts and GA4.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they manage large budgets responsibly?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Our PPC Managers are vetted for both technical platform expertise and budget management judgment. During the scoping call we discuss your monthly budget, target CPA/ROAS, account structure, and conversion tracking setup to ensure a clean handoff.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does pricing look like?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated PPC Managers start at approximately $2,500/month for full-time (40h/week). Part-time (20h/week) arrangements are available for teams with lower ad spend or fewer active channels. Pricing depends on experience level, platform scope, and account complexity.',
