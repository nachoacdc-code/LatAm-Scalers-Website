	{
		question: 'What does Construction Admin Support handle?',
		answer:
			'Construction Admin Support manages the documentation and coordination workflows that keep projects moving after design: processing RFIs, logging and tracking submittals, maintaining document control systems, coordinating field observation reports, managing punch lists, and organizing closeout documentation. They work in your project management platform under your project manager or architect of record\'s direction.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Is this a project management role or an administrative role?',
		answer:
			'It\'s a documentation and coordination role. Your Construction Admin Support specialist doesn\'t make design or construction decisions — they keep the document flow organized so your PMs, architects, and engineers can focus on decisions rather than paperwork. Think of it as your project\'s operations backbone.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What platforms do they work in?',
		answer:
			'Our Construction Admin Support specialists are proficient in Procore, Autodesk Construction Cloud (ACC/BIM 360), PlanGrid, Bluebeam, and standard office tools. We match platform experience to your specific tech stack during the scoping call.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they handle multiple projects simultaneously?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Experienced Construction Admin specialists routinely manage documentation workflows across 3–5 concurrent projects, depending on project size and CA activity volume. For firms with very high project counts, we can configure a dedicated CA pod.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the cost savings vs. a US-based Construction Admin coordinator?',
		answer:
			'US-based Construction Admin coordinators typically cost $55,000–$80,000/year fully loaded. LATAM-based equivalents through LatAm Scalers start at approximately $2,500/month ($30,000/year) — a savings of 50–70% while maintaining the same documentation rigor and responsiveness.',
