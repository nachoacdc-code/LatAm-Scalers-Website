	{
		question: 'What does a CAD Technician do?',
		answer:
			'A CAD Technician produces and maintains 2D construction drawings using AutoCAD or MicroStation. They draft floor plans, sections, elevations, and detail sheets from redline markups or design sketches provided by your licensed architects and engineers. They also manage title blocks, layer standards, xrefs, and drawing archives to keep your document sets organized and production-ready.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Do your CAD Technicians work in Revit or only AutoCAD?',
		answer:
			'Our CAD Technicians are primarily AutoCAD production specialists. Many also have working knowledge of Revit for extracting views, placing annotations, or assisting with basic model cleanup — but if your workflow is Revit-primary, a dedicated Revit Drafter or BIM Coordinator may be a better fit.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can a CAD Technician handle redline markups independently?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Experienced CAD Technicians interpret redline markups from architects and engineers and translate them into updated drawing sets. They flag ambiguous markups for clarification rather than guessing — keeping your revision cycles fast and accurate.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the cost savings vs. a US-based CAD Technician?',
		answer:
			'US-based CAD Technicians typically cost $50,000–$75,000/year fully loaded. LATAM-based equivalents through LatAm Scalers start at approximately $2,800/month ($33,600/year) — a savings of 50–70% with no compromise on drafting quality or turnaround speed.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How quickly can we onboard a CAD Technician?',
		answer:
			'We typically present vetted candidates within 48 hours of a scoping call. Once your drawing standards, templates, and tool access are confirmed, most CAD Technicians are production-ready within one week.',
	},

		overview="Your dedicated CAD Technician handles the high-volume drafting work that keeps your project pipeline moving — floor plans, sections, elevations, details, and redline revisions — in your AutoCAD or MicroStation environment. Working under your project architects and engineers, they free your senior staff to focus on design decisions and client coordination instead of production output. And they do it at 50%+ lower cost than a US-based hire, on a month-to-month basis with no long-term commitment."
