	title: 'Hire a Dedicated HVAC Designer — Pre-Vetted LATAM MEP Talent for US Firms | LatAm Scalers',
	description:
		'Hire a dedicated HVAC designer for US AEC and MEP firms. Load calculations (Manual J/D), ductwork design, equipment selection, energy modeling, and Revit MEP coordination. Pre-vetted LATAM talent. From ~$3,500/mo.',

	{
		question: 'What does an HVAC Designer do on a commercial MEP project?',
		answer:
			'An HVAC Designer performs heating and cooling load calculations (Manual J/D and ASHRAE methods), selects HVAC equipment (AHUs, VAV boxes, fan coils, rooftop units), designs ductwork distribution layouts, produces mechanical schedules and equipment specifications, and coordinates with structural and architectural disciplines for equipment clearances and penetrations. They work under your licensed Mechanical Engineer of Record.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can your HVAC Designers do energy modeling and Title 24 / ASHRAE 90.1 compliance?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Our experienced HVAC Designers are familiar with ASHRAE 90.1 compliance requirements and can support Title 24 documentation workflows. For full energy modeling outputs (e.g., EnergyPlus, eQUEST simulations), we can match you with specialists with energy modeling backgrounds. Scope is confirmed at the staffing call.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What software proficiencies do your HVAC Designers have?',
		answer:
			'Our HVAC Designers work in Revit MEP for coordinated mechanical BIM models, AutoCAD for 2D plan and detail production, Carrier HAP and Trane TRACE 700 for load calculations and equipment selection, and Navisworks for multi-discipline clash detection. Tool proficiency is vetted during our screening process.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they handle ductwork coordination with structural and architectural teams?',
		answer:
			'HVAC Designers coordinate ductwork routing through federated Revit models or linked AutoCAD files, running clash detection against structural framing, beams, and architectural ceiling plenum constraints. They flag conflicts, propose routing solutions, and update models based on coordination resolutions — all under your project engineer\'s direction.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does it cost to hire an HVAC Designer through LatAm Scalers?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated HVAC Designers start at approximately $3,500/month for full-time engagement (40h/week). Part-time and MEP pod configurations are also available. US-based equivalents typically cost $75,000–$115,000/year fully loaded — LATAM saves 50–65% with no reduction in technical output quality.',

		overview="Your dedicated HVAC Designer brings mechanical engineering design support at 50%+ lower cost than a US-based hire. They perform load calculations, design ductwork distribution systems, select equipment, and produce fully coordinated Revit MEP models under the direction of your licensed Mechanical Engineer of Record. With 4,400+ monthly searches for 'hvac load calculation,' HVAC design represents one of the highest-demand remote AEC functions — and every specialist is pre-vetted to meet those standards."
