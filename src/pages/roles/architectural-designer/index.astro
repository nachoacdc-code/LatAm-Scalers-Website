		question: 'What work does a dedicated architectural designer handle?',
		answer:
			'Our architectural designers handle schematic design, design development, Revit 3D modeling, construction documentation, redline revisions, coordination sets, and 3D visualization. They work under the direction of your licensed architects — producing deliverables, not making design decisions.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Who retains design authority and stamping?',
		answer:
			'Your licensed architects retain full design authority, code compliance responsibility, and stamping rights. Our designers produce work under your direction. All deliverables require your review and sign-off before use.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they adapt to our CAD and BIM standards?',
		answer:
			'During onboarding we align on your templates, layer standards, annotation styles, title block formats, and BIM execution plan. Designers follow your firm standards from day one and QA their work against your checklist before submitting.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they work in SketchUp, Lumion, or Rhino in addition to Revit?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Many of our architectural designers are proficient across multiple tools. We match candidates to your specific tool stack during the placement process. Common combinations: Revit + AutoCAD, Revit + SketchUp + Lumion, or Revit + Rhino + Enscape.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does pricing typically look like?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated architectural designers start at approximately $3,500/month for full-time (40h/week). Part-time (20h/week) options are available. Custom quotes are provided after the scoping call based on experience level and scope.',

		overview="Our architectural designers bring firm-level expertise at 50%+ lower cost than US-based equivalents. They're fluent in English, timezone-aligned with your US team (0–3 hours behind EST/CST), and pre-vetted for Revit, AutoCAD, SketchUp, and Lumion. They produce schematic drawings, design development sets, construction documents, and 3D visualizations — all under the direction of your licensed architects."
