	{
		question: 'What does a Motion Graphics Specialist do?',
		answer:
			'A Motion Graphics Specialist creates animated visual content — animated ads, explainer videos, kinetic typography, visual effects, lower thirds, and motion design elements. They combine design, animation, and video production to create engaging, information-forward video content for marketing, product, and sales use.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What software do they work in?',
		answer:
			'Motion Graphics Specialists typically work in Adobe After Effects (primary animation tool), Adobe Premiere Pro (video editing), and often Cinema 4D or Blender for 3D motion design. They also use Figma for design direction and Final Cut Pro for alternative workflows.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they create explainer videos?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Explainer videos — animated breakdowns of complex ideas, processes, or product features — are one of the most common motion graphics deliverables. Most specialists work with script, voiceover, and design direction to produce polished explainers.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they work with brand guidelines?',
		answer:
			'Motion Graphics Specialists receive your brand guidelines, color palettes, and design systems, then produce all animations within those constraints. They create custom templates and animation libraries specific to your brand voice.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the cost?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Motion Graphics Specialists start at approximately $3,200–$3,500/month for full-time engagement (40h/week). US-based equivalents typically cost $70,000–$110,000/year fully loaded — LATAM-based specialists save 50–65% with comparable output quality and animation skill.',
