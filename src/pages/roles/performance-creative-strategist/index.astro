		question: 'What does a Performance Creative Strategist do?',
		answer:
			'A Performance Creative Strategist designs and produces video and visual creative specifically optimized for paid social and performance marketing channels. They focus on weekly/bi-weekly refresh cycles, testing new creative hooks, formats, and messaging to overcome ad fatigue. Unlike brand designers, they\'re metrics-focused and iterate based on ROAS, CTR, and conversion data.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How frequently do they produce new creative?',
		answer:
			'Performance Creative Strategists typically produce 4–8 new video concepts or static ad variations per week. They work in rapid cycles — Monday ideation → Wednesday shoots/editing → Friday launches. This 60–80% YoY creative demand in DTC makes them essential for combating ad fatigue.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they handle both video and static creative?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Most Performance Creative Strategists are proficient in both short-form video (TikTok, Reels, YouTube Shorts) and static carousel ads. They understand platform-specific formats, captions, pacing, and hooks optimized for each channel.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Do they work with analytics or ad managers?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Performance Creative Strategists work closely with your performance marketing or ad ops team to understand what\'s working, what\'s fatiguing, and what to test next. They receive weekly performance data and use it to inform creative direction.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does a Performance Creative Strategist cost?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Performance Creative Strategists start at approximately $3,200–$3,500/month for full-time engagement (40h/week). US-based equivalents typically cost $70,000–$105,000/year fully loaded — LATAM-based specialists save 50–65% with comparable production velocity.',
