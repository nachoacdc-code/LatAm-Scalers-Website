	{
		question: 'What does a Structural Drafter do?',
		answer:
			'A Structural Drafter produces construction documents for structural systems: framing plans, elevation views, connection details, foundation plans, rebar schedules, and structural notes. They work in Revit Structure or AutoCAD under the direction of your licensed Structural Engineer of Record, translating engineering calculations and design intent into construction-ready drawings.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they model in Revit Structure or do they work in AutoCAD?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Structural Drafters we match you with are proficient in both Revit Structure for coordinated BIM environments and AutoCAD for traditional 2D production workflows — matched to your project delivery method.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Who is responsible for design authority and stamping?',
		answer:
			'Your licensed Structural Engineer of Record retains full design authority and stamp responsibility. Your dedicated Structural Drafter produces drawings and details under your engineer\'s direction, subject to your review and approval before any permit submission.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do Structural Drafters coordinate with architectural and MEP teams?',
		answer:
			'Structural Drafters coordinate through federated Revit models or linked AutoCAD files, running clash detection against architectural and MEP systems. They flag conflicts, flag proposed resolutions, and update drawings based on coordination outcomes — all under your structural engineer\'s direction.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the cost savings vs. a US-based Structural Drafter?',
		answer:
			'US-based Structural Drafters typically cost $60,000–$90,000/year fully loaded. LATAM-based equivalents through LatAm Scalers start at approximately $3,500/month ($42,000/year) — a savings of 50–70% with no compromise on drafting quality or technical accuracy.',

		overview="Your dedicated Structural Drafter brings production expertise at 50%+ lower cost than a US-based hire. They transform structural calculations into construction-ready drawing sets — framing plans, connections, foundation details, and rebar schedules — in your Revit or AutoCAD environment. Working under your licensed SE, they integrate directly into your project delivery pipeline, freeing your senior engineers for analysis and design judgment work."

		whyRemote="Structural drafting is entirely digital and production-focused — making it ideal for dedicated remote work. Your Structural Drafter works in your Revit or AutoCAD environment during your US business hours, participates in coordination meetings, and produces sheets to your firm's standard templates. LATAM timezone overlap (0–3 hours behind EST/CST) ensures real-time communication."
