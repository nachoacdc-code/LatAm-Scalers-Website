	{
		question: 'What does a Packaging Designer do?',
		answer:
			'A Packaging Designer creates end-to-end packaging experiences — from structural design (box dimensions, materials) to graphic design (labels, unboxing experience). They balance aesthetic brand expression, functional specifications, manufacturing constraints, and cost optimization. For DTC brands, packaging is a key brand touchpoint and marketing asset.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Do they handle both graphic design and structural design?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Most Packaging Designers have dual expertise — they design the visual branding/graphics and work with manufacturers to understand structural requirements (folds, die lines, material specs). Some specialize more in graphics; others in structural — we match to your needs.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the typical project timeline?',
		answer:
			'Packaging projects typically run 4–8 weeks from concept through production-ready files. This includes: design concept, iterations, structural engineering, die-line development, and pre-production proofs with your manufacturer.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they manage the vendor and manufacturing relationship?',
		answer:
			'Packaging Designers typically collaborate with your packaging vendor/manufacturer but don\'t manage the relationship themselves. They produce print-ready and structural files your vendor can use; ongoing vendor communication is your responsibility.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the cost?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Packaging Designers start at approximately $3,000–$3,500/month for full-time engagement (40h/week). US-based equivalents typically cost $65,000–$95,000/year fully loaded — LATAM-based specialists save 50–65% with comparable design quality and packaging expertise.',
