		question: 'What does a dedicated SEO Specialist do?',
		answer:
			'Your dedicated SEO Specialist handles technical SEO audits, on-page optimization, keyword research, content brief creation, internal linking strategy, Core Web Vitals monitoring, and monthly performance reporting — in Ahrefs, Semrush, Google Search Console, Screaming Frog, and GA4.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they work across technical and content SEO?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Your SEO Specialist covers both technical SEO (site audits, crawl optimization, schema implementation, speed improvements) and content SEO (keyword research, content briefs, on-page optimization, content gap analysis). For larger programs, we can match a specialist who focuses on one area.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they integrate with our content or engineering teams?',
		answer:
			'Your SEO Specialist joins your content or marketing rituals, collaborates with writers to brief content, and works with engineers on technical implementation tasks. They deliver clear recommendations with priority levels — you decide which items to action and when.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Do they produce content or only strategy?',
		answer:
			'SEO Specialists produce strategy, audits, briefs, and recommendations — they are not content writers. For content production, combine an SEO Specialist with a Content Marketer. The SEO Specialist briefs topics and keywords; the Content Marketer writes the posts.',

		question: 'What does pricing look like?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated SEO Specialists start at approximately $2,500/month for full-time (40h/week). Part-time (20h/week) options are available for teams that need strategy and audit work without full-time volume. Custom quotes provided after scoping call.',
