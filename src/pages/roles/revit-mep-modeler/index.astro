	{
		question: 'What is a Revit MEP Modeler and how do they differ from a mechanical designer?',
		answer:
			'A Revit MEP Modeler focuses on building and coordinating the 3D BIM model for mechanical (HVAC ductwork and piping), electrical (conduit, cable tray, raceway), and plumbing systems within Revit MEP. Unlike a discipline designer who performs load calculations and system engineering, a Revit MEP Modeler specializes in model production, routing coordination, and delivering clash-ready BIM models at the highest documentation quality — often supporting multiple engineering disciplines simultaneously.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can a Revit MEP Modeler handle clash detection independently?',
		answer:
			'Your dedicated Revit MEP Modeler produces models that are ready for clash detection runs and can participate in Navisworks coordination workflows — identifying and documenting clashes, tracking issues in ACC or BIM 360, and updating models after resolution. Full clash management and resolution authority remains with your project engineer or BIM coordinator.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What MEP disciplines can your Revit MEP Modelers cover?',
		answer:
			'Our specialists typically cover mechanical (HVAC ductwork, piping, equipment placement), plumbing (sanitary, domestic water, storm), and electrical (conduit, cable tray, panel locations, light fixtures) in Revit MEP. Depth of coverage depends on the specialist\'s background — we match you with a modeler whose proficiency aligns to your project requirements.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they integrate with our in-house MEP engineers?',
		answer:
			'Your Revit MEP Modeler works as a production extension of your in-house team. They receive engineering input (equipment layouts, system selections, routing intent) from your engineers and translate it into coordinated BIM models, following your BEP, Revit template standards, and coordination workflow. Regular check-ins, shared Revit worksharing environments, and ACC/BIM 360 ensure seamless integration.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does a Revit MEP Modeler cost through LatAm Scalers?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Revit MEP Modelers start at approximately $3,500/month for full-time engagement (40h/week). Part-time and MEP pod configurations are available. This represents 50–65% cost savings vs. a US-based Revit MEP specialist ($70,000–$100,000/year fully loaded) with no compromise on model quality or coordination responsiveness.',

		overview="Revit MEP Modelers represent the highest remote-suitability role in the AEC sector — the work is entirely digital, tool-dependent, and production-oriented. Your dedicated Revit MEP Modeler produces coordinated ductwork, piping, and electrical raceway models, following your BEP standards and worksharing protocols. They integrate as a production arm for your in-house MEP engineers, accelerating output and freeing your senior team for engineering judgment work — at 50%+ lower cost than US-based equivalents."

		whyRemote="Revit MEP modeling is the most remote-native function in AEC — the work is entirely software-based, deliverables are digital files, and collaboration happens through shared cloud models, issue trackers, and video calls. Your Revit MEP Modeler works in your Revit server or cloud worksharing environment during US business hours. LATAM timezone overlap (0–3 hours behind EST/CST) enables daily coordination check-ins without project delay. This is why Revit MEP modeling consistently ranks as the top remote AEC placement category."
