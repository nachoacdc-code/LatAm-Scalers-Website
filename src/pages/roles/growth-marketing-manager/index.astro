		question: 'What is a Growth Marketing Manager?',
		answer:
			'A Growth Marketing Manager owns cross-channel growth strategy and execution for SaaS — demand gen, paid advertising, organic channels, and partnerships. They think beyond siloed channels and focus on full-funnel growth from awareness through expansion revenue. They\'re data-driven, experiment-obsessed, and focused on measurable growth metrics.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they differ from a traditional demand gen manager?',
		answer:
			'Demand gen focuses primarily on lead generation and paid advertising; growth marketing managers think more broadly about growth loops, retention, expansion, and multi-channel optimization. Growth managers are strategic; demand gen managers are execution-focused.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is SaaS Tier 1+2 demand?',
		answer:
			'SaaS Tier 1 companies ($10M–$50M ARR) and Tier 2 ($1M–$10M ARR) are the primary demand segments for growth managers. These companies are scaling rapidly and need growth leadership.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they manage campaigns across channels?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Growth Marketing Managers typically oversee paid search, paid social, content marketing, partnerships, and experimentation across channels. They may not execute all tactics directly but orchestrate and optimize across them.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does a Growth Marketing Manager cost?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Growth Marketing Managers start at approximately $3,200–$3,500/month for full-time engagement (40h/week). US-based equivalents typically cost $85,000–$130,000/year fully loaded — LATAM-based managers save 55–70%.',
