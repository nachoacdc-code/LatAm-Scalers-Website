	{
		question: 'What does a dedicated brand & visual designer produce?',
		answer:
			'Our brand and visual designers handle brand system updates, marketing asset production (social, digital ads, email templates, presentations), visual identity consistency work, and packaging design. They work from your existing brand guidelines and produce assets aligned to your standards — consistently, week after week.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How is this different from a design subscription service?',
		answer:
			'With a dedicated designer, the same person works exclusively on your brand every week. They learn your style guide, stakeholder preferences, and asset library deeply — producing better-quality work faster as time goes on. Design subscription services rotate through different designers and don\'t accumulate institutional brand knowledge.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What tools do your designers use?',
		answer:
			'Our brand and visual designers primarily work in Adobe Creative Cloud (Illustrator, InDesign, Photoshop) and Figma. Many are also proficient in Canva Enterprise, After Effects (basic motion), and presentation tools like Google Slides and PowerPoint.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they handle high-volume asset production?',
		answer:
			'Yes. A dedicated full-time designer produces approximately 40 hours of design output per week. For higher volume needs, we can configure a small team (2–3 designers with optional PM) through our Managed Creative Teams offering.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does pricing look like?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated brand and visual designers start at approximately $2,800/month for full-time (40h/week). Part-time options are available. Pricing depends on experience level, seniority, and engagement configuration.',

		whyRemote="Brand and visual design is output-driven and async-friendly. Designers receive briefs, produce assets, and share for review during your business hours. LATAM timezone overlap (0–3 hours behind EST/CST) means you can do review-revision cycles within the same working day. For a high-output dedicated designer, this is operationally equivalent to a local hire — at a dramatically lower cost."
