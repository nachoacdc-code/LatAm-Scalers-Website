		question: 'What does a dedicated content marketer produce?',
		answer:
			'Our content marketers produce SEO-optimized blog posts (1,000–2,500+ words), email nurture sequences, landing page copy, social content, content calendars, and distribution plans. They work from SEO briefs or develop their own keyword research using Semrush or Ahrefs.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they write technical content for SaaS or B2B?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Our content marketers cover B2B, SaaS, and technical content categories. They research topics deeply, use your SME interviews or internal knowledge base, and produce content aligned to your brand voice. We match based on your industry and content requirements.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Do they work in HubSpot or WordPress?',
		answer:
			'Most dedicated content marketers we match you with are proficient in HubSpot (content, blog, email tools) and WordPress. They format, schedule, and publish content directly in your CMS — not just write and hand off in Google Docs.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they get up to speed on our brand voice?',
		answer:
			'During onboarding we share your style guide, brand voice document, existing content examples, and target audience personas. Most content marketers produce on-brand content by their second or third piece after initial feedback rounds.',

		question: 'What does pricing look like?',

			'Dedicated content marketers start at approximately $2,500/month for full-time (40h/week). Part-time (20h/week) arrangements are available for teams with lighter content volume. Pricing depends on experience level and content complexity.',
