		question: 'What does a dedicated UI/UX designer deliver?',
		answer:
			'Our UI/UX designers deliver user research (interviews, surveys, persona development), information architecture, wireframes, interactive prototypes, usability testing support, and annotated design handoffs to engineering. They cover the full spectrum from discovery to production-ready specs.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Do your UI/UX designers work in Figma?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Figma is the primary tool for UI design, prototyping, and handoff. For research and testing, designers use Maze for remote usability testing and Hotjar for session recording and heatmap analysis. We match candidates to your specific toolchain during placement.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they focus on research-only or UX-only work?',
		answer:
			'We typically place full-spectrum UI/UX designers who can move from research through prototyping and handoff. For narrowly scoped research or testing sprints, we can configure a part-time or project-based engagement focused on specific deliverables.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How do they work with our product and engineering teams?',
		answer:
			'Your UI/UX designer joins your product/design rituals — standups, design reviews, sprint planning. They collaborate directly with PMs and engineers, deliver annotated specs in Figma, and are available during your business hours for sync calls and async feedback.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does pricing look like?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated UI/UX designers start at approximately $2,800/month for full-time (40h/week). Part-time (20h/week) and hybrid UX/UI roles are available. Pricing depends on experience level, seniority, and engagement type.',
