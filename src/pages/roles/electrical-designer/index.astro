	{
		question: 'What does an Electrical Designer do on a typical MEP project?',
		answer:
			'An Electrical Designer produces power distribution layouts, lighting design with fixture schedules, panel schedules, one-line diagrams, load calculations, branch circuit plans, and equipment coordination. They work under the oversight of your licensed electrical engineer, producing construction documents aligned to NEC and local jurisdictional requirements.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Who stamps and takes design authority for electrical drawings?',
		answer:
			'Your licensed Electrical Engineer of Record retains full design authority and stamp responsibility. Our Electrical Designers produce drawings and calculations under your direction, subject to your review and sign-off before any submission or permit issuance.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What software do your Electrical Designers use?',
		answer:
			'Our specialists are proficient in Revit MEP for coordinated BIM electrical models, AutoCAD and AutoCAD Electrical for 2D production drafting, AGi32 and DIALux for lighting calculations, and ETAP for power system analysis (where required). We align with your preferred platform and deliverable format.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How quickly can we onboard a vetted Electrical Designer?',
		answer:
			'We typically present vetted candidates within 48 hours after a scoping call. Once project standards, templates, and tool access are confirmed, most designers ramp up within one week.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the cost difference vs. a US-based Electrical Designer?',
		answer:
			'US-based junior-to-mid Electrical Designers typically cost $70,000–$110,000/year fully loaded. LATAM-based equivalents through LatAm Scalers start at approximately $3,500/month ($42,000/year) — a savings of 50–70% with no reduction in technical quality.',
