		question: 'What does a dedicated Web Designer produce?',
		answer:
			'A dedicated Web Designer creates website layouts, landing pages, responsive page templates, and marketing site designs. They work in Figma for design and prototyping, producing clean handoff files your development team can implement directly. Many also have fluency in Webflow or Framer — the workflow (design-only vs. design-and-publish) is confirmed during your scoping call.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Do they design in Figma and hand off, or can they also build in Webflow or Framer?',
		answer:
			'Our primary focus is design quality — Figma layouts, responsive specs, and clean developer handoffs. Many of the designers we match also have Webflow or Framer fluency. During the scoping call we confirm your workflow: if your team implements from Figma files, we match for design depth; if you want the designer to publish directly, we confirm that capability during matching.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How is this different from a UI/UX Designer?',
		answer:
			'A Web Designer focuses on marketing websites, landing pages, and content-driven pages — optimizing for visual impact, conversion, and brand consistency. A UI/UX Designer focuses on product interfaces, user flows, and interaction design for SaaS or app experiences. Some designers span both, but we match based on your primary need.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they maintain and update an existing site?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Dedicated Web Designers handle ongoing site maintenance: new page creation, layout updates, A/B test variants, blog templates, and CMS content structuring. Having the same designer on your site every week means consistent quality and faster turnaround as they learn your system.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does pricing look like?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Web Designers start at approximately $2,800/month for full-time (40h/week). Part-time options are available. Pricing depends on the skill profile required (design-only vs. design-and-build), platform expertise (Webflow, Framer, WordPress), and seniority level.',

		overview="Your dedicated Web Designer owns your website's visual execution — from new page designs to ongoing layout updates and landing page production. Unlike freelancers or agencies billing per project, a dedicated designer learns your brand system, CMS structure, and conversion patterns deeply, producing faster and more consistent work over time. Our primary engagement is design-first: Figma files, responsive layouts, and clean developer handoffs. Many designers also have Webflow or Framer fluency — whether they build directly or hand off to your dev team is confirmed during scoping based on your workflow."
