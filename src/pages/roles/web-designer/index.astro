	{
		question: 'What does a dedicated Web Designer produce?',
		answer:
			'A dedicated Web Designer creates website layouts, landing pages, responsive page templates, and marketing site designs. They work in Figma for design and prototyping, and many also build directly in Webflow or Framer — delivering production-ready pages without requiring a separate developer for marketing sites.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they build in Webflow or Framer, or just design in Figma?',
		answer:
			'Many of our Web Designers are hybrid design-build specialists who work natively in Webflow, Framer, or both. During the scoping call, we confirm whether you need design-only (Figma handoff to your dev team) or design-and-build (the designer publishes directly in your CMS). We match accordingly.',
	},
	{
		question: 'How is this different from a UI/UX Designer?',
		answer:
			'A Web Designer focuses on marketing websites, landing pages, and content-driven pages — optimizing for visual impact, conversion, and brand consistency. A UI/UX Designer focuses on product interfaces, user flows, and interaction design for SaaS or app experiences. Some designers span both, but we match based on your primary need.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they maintain and update an existing site?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Dedicated Web Designers handle ongoing site maintenance: new page creation, layout updates, A/B test variants, blog templates, and CMS content structuring. Having the same designer on your site every week means consistent quality and faster turnaround as they learn your system.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What does pricing look like?',
		answer:
			'Dedicated Web Designers start at approximately $2,800/month for full-time (40h/week). Part-time options are available. Pricing depends on the skill profile required (design-only vs. design-and-build), platform expertise (Webflow, Framer, WordPress), and seniority level.',

		overview="Your dedicated Web Designer owns your website's visual execution — from new page designs to ongoing layout updates and landing page production.
