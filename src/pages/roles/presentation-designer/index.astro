		question: 'What does a Presentation Designer do?',
		answer:
			'A Presentation Designer creates high-polish, persuasive deck design for investor pitches, client presentations, research decks, and executive communication. They combine data visualization, typography, layout design, and narrative structure to transform complex information into clear, compelling visual stories. Typical rate is $200–$400/hour; LATAM remote talent offers equivalent quality at 50% cost.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What types of presentations do they create?',
		answer:
			'Presentation Designers work across pitch decks (fundraising), client proposals, research decks, board presentations, annual reports, and stakeholder materials. Each has distinct design requirements and information hierarchy.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Can they handle data visualization and charts?',
		answer:
			'Yes. Data visualization is core to presentation design — designing charts, graphs, and infographics that make complex data accessible and persuasive. They work with your data and transform it into visual narratives.',
	},
	{
		question: 'Do they work from existing slides or create from scratch?',
		answer:
			'Both. Some projects involve refining existing content; others are greenfield deck builds. They typically work from your content/copy and transform it into polished visual decks over 1–2 week timelines.',
	},
	{
		question: 'What is the cost vs. hiring a designer on retainer?',
		answer:
			'Boutique presentation designers (McKinsey design alumni, etc.) charge $200–$400/hour. A dedicated full-time presenter designer through LatAm Scalers costs approximately $3,200–$3,500/month ($40/hour equivalent) — saving 80–90% of hourly rates while maintaining quality.',
